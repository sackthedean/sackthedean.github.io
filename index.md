Welcome to **SackTheDean.com**, a community-driven initiative demanding accountability and integrity within the University of Nevada, Reno's College of Engineering.

Recent investigations have uncovered concerning practices involving the current Dean of the College of Engineering, Dr. Erick C. Jones. Reports from reputable sources, including Retraction Watch and the Nevada Sagebrush, have highlighted a pattern of publishing questionable academic papers, raising serious doubts about the Dean's adherence to academic standards and ethical practices.

In light of these findings, we, the students, alumni, faculty, and concerned citizens, call for Dean Jones' immediate resignation to uphold the integrity and reputation of UNR and its engineering program. We believe in the importance of leadership that exemplifies the highest standards of academic excellence, transparency, and ethical conduct.

We have launched a [Change.org petition](https://www.change.org/p/resign-dean-jones) to gather support for this cause. By signing the petition, you are not just voicing your concern but also joining a broader community committed to fostering an academic environment built on trust, respect, and accountability.
